# Helios
# Introduction
Helios is Zaviel Chung's undergraduate graduate project.
Helios is a system like below image showing. We use drone Tello edu and using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Openpifpaf]([https://pytorch.org/](https://openpifpaf.github.io/intro.html)) to fullfill Image detection. About our simple Helios APP we use [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) as our APP development framework.
