# Helios
# Introduction
Helios is Zaviel Chung's undergraduate graduate project in Feng Chia University.
Helios is a system like below image showing. Helios is been created for the purpose of saving someone who facing accidental problem in any kinds of activities. We suppose the sport activity with a short length of runway. With drones at the setting locate, its will detect if runner fall down or have a pose to drone. If so our staff in medical station or staff who notice the warning on their phonet will be able to check the stream from the drone. They will find the runner with the warning shows and give runner the help they need. 
# Using
We use drone Tello edu and using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Openpifpaf]([https://pytorch.org/](https://openpifpaf.github.io/intro.html)) to fullfill Image detection. About our simple Helios APP we use [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) as our APP development framework.
